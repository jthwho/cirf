    config CIRF_MAX_PATH
        int "Maximum path length for lookups"
        default 256
        range 64 1024
        help
            Maximum path length for cirf_find_file() and cirf_find_folder().
            Uses stack allocation. Reduce for memory-constrained devices.

    config CIRF_NO_STDIO
        bool "Disable FILE* functions"
        default y
        help
            Disable cirf_fopen() and related functions.
            Recommended for ESP32 as fmemopen() is not available.

    config CIRF_NO_MOUNT
        bool "Disable mount system"
        default y
        help
            Disable cirf_mount() and related functions.
            Saves code size and avoids malloc/free usage.
            Recommended for simple embedded projects.
