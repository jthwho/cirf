# CIRF Examples
#
# These examples are standalone projects designed to be built independently.
# They serve as templates for integrating CIRF into your own projects.
#
# To build an example:
#   cd examples/simple
#   mkdir build && cd build
#   cmake ..
#   make
#
# The examples are NOT built as part of the main CIRF build because they
# demonstrate how to use CIRF from an external project.
